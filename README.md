# cecs-278-project-1
This was my submission for Project 1 of my Object Oriented Application Development class.
The goal of this assignment was to create a text-based dungeon crawler game with Java.

The src folder contains the source code of the application.
The textfiles folder contains premade assets of maps, enemies, and items.

Some template code was provided by the professor of the course, Shannon Cleary.
